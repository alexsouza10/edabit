/*
 * The Farm Problem
 * 
 * In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:

 * chickens = 2 legs
 * cows = 4 legs
 * pigs = 4 legs
 * 
 * The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.
 * 
 *  Examples: 
 * 
 * animals(2, 3, 5) âžž 36
